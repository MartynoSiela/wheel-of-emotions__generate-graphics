# Wheel of Emotions 
## Introduction
This repository is part of a bigger project: an app which has a clickable, spinnable wheel of emotions ([Example](http://images.google.com/images?q=emotion_wheel)).
The code in this repository is responsible for two things:
1. Creation of an xml file for the wheel which contains all the paths for each of the sections.
2. Creation of an svg file for the texts of the emotions
## Usage
Path to both files (location and name of the file to be created) need to be entered to `app.properties` file
